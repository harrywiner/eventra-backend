With inspiration from Nick Hern's adaptation, it delves into themes of surveillance and control, offering a haunting and immersive experience that challenges perceptions of truth and reality. Through expressive movement and visceral choreography, audiences are transported into Orwell's dystopian universe, feeling the oppressive atmosphere of Big Brother's world firsthand. This innovative fusion of physicality and narrative captivates spectators, leaving a lasting impact and sparking thought-provoking conversations about the state of our society and the dangers of unchecked power.; Category: Theatre",
